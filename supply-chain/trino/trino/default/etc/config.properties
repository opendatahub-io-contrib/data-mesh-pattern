# Configurable memory settings:

# query.max-cpu-time  # default=1_000_000_000d
# This is the max amount of CPU time that a query can use across the entire cluster. Queries that exceed this limit are killed.

# query.max-memory-per-node  # default=(JVM max memory * 0.3)
# This is the max amount of user memory a query can use on a worker. User memory is allocated during execution for things that
# are directly attributable to, or controllable by, a user query. For example, memory used by the hash tables built during
# execution, memory used during sorting, etc. When the user memory allocation of a query on any worker hits this limit, it is killed.

# query.max-memory  # default=20GB
# This is the max amount of user memory a query can use across the entire cluster. User memory is allocated during execution for
# things that are directly attributable to, or controllable by, a user query. For example, memory used by the hash tables built
# during execution, memory used during sorting, etc. When the user memory allocation of a query across all workers hits this limit
# it is killed.

# query.max-total-memory  # default=(query.max-memory * 2)
# This is the max amount of memory a query can use across the entire cluster, including revocable memory. When the memory allocated
# by a query across all workers hits this limit it is killed. The value of query.max-total-memory must be greater than query.max-memory.

# query.max-memory-per-task  # default=none, and therefore unrestricted
# This is the max amount of the memory a task can use on a node in the cluster. Support for using this property is experimental only.

# memory.heap-headroom-per-node  # default=(JVM max memory * 0.3)
# This is the amount of memory set aside as headroom/buffer in the JVM heap for allocations that are not tracked by Trino.
